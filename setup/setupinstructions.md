# Setup Instructions
## Prerequisites
This project uses the following tools:
- **Git**: Git and GitHub will be used for all code housing and version control of this project. If not already installed, the Git command line tools are highly recommended, with installation instructions found [at the official git startup guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 
    - To get the code from this project, run the following command line function in a folder of your choice:  
    ```git
    git clone https://github.com/McMasterAI/StyleGAN.git
    ```
- **Python 3**: All model code will be done in Python 3. Some application code may be done through JS, but that'll be tackled later on. This will come packaged natively with Ubuntu, but if you are running this on a different OS, download and installation instructions for the latest Python 3 release can be found [at the official python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
    - **pip** will also be used as a package manager for Python 3, included by default in the Python 3 installation, just make sure you don't do a custom install without it
