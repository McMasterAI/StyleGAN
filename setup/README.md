# Setup Instructions
## Prerequisites
This project uses the following tools:
- **Git**: Git and GitHub will be used for all code housing and version control of this project. If not already installed, the Git command line tools are highly recommended, with installation instructions found [at the official git startup guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 
    - To get the code from this project, run the following command line function in a folder of your choice:  
    ```git
    git clone https://github.com/McMasterAI/StyleGAN.git
    ```
- **Python 3**: All model code will be done in Python 3. Some application code may be done through JS, but that'll be tackled later on. This will come packaged natively with Ubuntu, but if you are running this on a different OS, download and installation instructions for the latest Python 3 release can be found [at the official python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
    - **pip** will also be used as a package manager for Python 3, included by default in the Python 3 installation, just make sure you don't do a custom install without it
- **Jupyter Notebook**: All coding will also be done through Jupyter notebooks, for convenience of segmented code running and modification. To install notebooks, you can find instructions [at the official Jupyter install guide](https://jupyter.org/install), although it can be done with the command line:
    ```
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```
    - You can run the program once installed with the `jupyter notebook` command line function, and then navigate to this folder to look at the `ExampleNotebook.ipynb` file through the web interface.
- **ZenHub**: For issue and task management on the project, we will be using GitHub Issues and a free tie-in program called ZenHub. If you've ever worked in the field with software like JIRA or Trello, this will be very familiar. The program links directly with your GitHub account, and can be found [at the official ZenHub site](https://www.zenhub.com/).
    - You can view your issues on this site, but I recommend that you get the web interface, as it will automatically add a tab to the GitHub page for ZenHub issues.
